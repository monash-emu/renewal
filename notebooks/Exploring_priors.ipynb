Under the assumption that the generation time follows a gamma distribution, Chen et al. generated estimates of the GT over several time windows during that period. Prior to the implementation of PHSMs, they estimated a mean generation time 7.27 days (95% CI 6.42 to 8.07) with a standard deviation of 3.81 days (95% CI 2.84 to 4.80). \n",
